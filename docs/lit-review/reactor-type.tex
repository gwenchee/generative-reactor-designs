\section{Reactor}
For this project, generative reactor design is explored for the 
\gls{FHR}. 
The \gls{FHR} is a reactor concept that uses high-temperature 
coated-particle particle fuel and a low pressure liquid fluoride-salt coolant 
\cite{forsberg_fluoride-salt-cooled_2012,facilitators_fluoride-salt-cooled_2013}.  
There are two types of \gls{FHR} fuel shapes that have been explored, 
each has \gls{TRISO} particles embedded in the matrix: circulating pebbles and 
hexagonal fuel plate elements.  

Advantages 
\begin{itemize}
    \item It has a low pressure primary system. 
\end{itemize}
