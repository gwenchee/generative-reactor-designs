Does the reactor go solid as soon as the reaction stops, or does the decay heat keep it liquid for a while. If so, how long before it becomes liquid? That should be a simple analysis, but I don't know anything about thermal hydraulics…- An advantage of solid fuel is that the fission products are contained. A disadvantage, compared to liquid fuel, is that the burnup is limited by material properties of the fuel materials. (What is the burnup limit for the pebble in the FHR?)-  ‘denatured’  MEANS {\textless}20\% enrichment""" Advantageous characteristics of the basic molten-salt reactor include:1) a reactor in which a ‘liquid core’ can burn a variety of fuels: 233 UF4 , 235 UF4  or 239 PuF4. Fuel salt in the form of uranium fluoride or plutonium fluoride is dissolved in the molten salt coolant and undergoes fission in the reactor core.2) Since the fuel is already molten in the primary coolant, there is no possibility of fuel meltdown. The primary coolant, its fuel and fission products can be easily immobilised in the event of a reactor ‘scram’ due to the salt’s high freezing ({\textasciitilde}458°C) temperature and low vapour pressure (evaporation rate). In the event of an emergency shutdown, the coolant can be drained into separate sub-critical holding tanks.3) The fluoride salt is known as FLiBe; standing for Fluoride-Lithium-Beryllium. FLiBe has a melting temperature of {\textasciitilde}458°C and a boiling temperature of {\textasciitilde}1400°C. The primary coolant fuel salt has a molar composition of 70\% 7 LiF, 18\% BeF2  and a 12\% mixture of 235 UF4 , ThF4  and ZrF4 . The secondary coolant salt responsible for driving the turbine generators is composed of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride only and has a 2:1 lithium to beryllium ratio (Li2 BeF4 ).4) FLiBe has a similar volumetric heat capacity and a similar thermal conductivity compared to pressurized water. The higher boiling point and lower vapour pressure of FLiBe means MSRs operate at higher thermal efficiencies, and the ability to operate without pressurisation compared to current water-cooled PWRs.5) Unlike Na-K coolants of Fast Breeder Reactors, FLiBe will not violently react with water or burn in air.6) Since MSRs do not require a pressurised primary-containment or a large secondary containment building for steam capture as needed for PWRs, MSR reactor size and back-up safety systems can be reduced in volume and complexity.7) Costly PWR fuel-bundle fabrication is unnecessary for liquid fueled MSRs, reducing operational costs.8) With a molten core with liquid fuel, krypton and xenon poisons can be out-gassed and removed from the primary coolant during operation, avoiding the ceramic cracking and damage associated with UO2  pellet irradiation.9) A liquid fuel MSR works well when deployed in tandem with a reprocessing facility to maintain minimum fissile inventory in the core. Fuel reprocessing including refueling and waste removal can occur whilst the MSR remains at power (ie. on-the-fly reprocessing). Also, sufficiently low fission inventory in the salt can be maintained so that decay heat could be minimised after reactor shutdown.10) Since the primary cooling loop operates at a high temperature (700°C - 1000°C), it is possible to use Brayton cycle turbines that are compact and have the potential to deliver 45\% thermal-mechanical conversion efficiency.Challenges to be addressed for liquid-fuel molten salts reactors with FLiBe:1) the primary coolant loop will be highly radioactive due to fission products being in solution with the primary coolant salt. This will complicate maintenance procedures which would require the use of flushing salts and remote handling techniques.2) Beryllium is chemically toxic.3) lithium-7 must be +99.99\% pure and its isotopic separation from Lithium-6 is costly. Lithium 6 is unwanted for its transmutation into tritium upon neutron capture. The presence of tritium (an isotope of hydrogen) can degrade the structural integrity of the containment vessel.4) Close attention must be paid to the chemical composition of the salt to maintain a chemically reduced solution for deterring uranium out-precipitation. The out precipitation of uranium would lead to solid uranium depositing on the bottom of the reactor vessel, causing local hot spots that may affect the integrity of the primary containment vessel. One manner of control is to vary the mixture of UF4  to UF3  during operations to maintain a slight excess of fluorine molecules.5) As the fuel is burnt in the core, fission products will be produced. Each fission product and daughter decay products would react differently with the metal alloy containment vessel. More work needs to be done to understand the reaction between alloys and fission products.6) The benefit of having a primary coolant with a high melting point that will ‘freeze easily’ to immobilize waste could result in some operational challenges. Some areas of the reactor that loose heat easily – eg heat exchanger surfaces and long narrow tubing, must be sufficiently well designed so they don’t freeze over during reactor operation.7) FLiBe salts have the ability to maintain a liquid form up to 1400°C, allowing the possibility for very high temperature operations. The metallic alloys containing the liquid thus become the system’s weakest link. To exploit FLiBe’s advantages, new metallic alloys or non-metallics (eg. C-Si) resistant to both high temperatures and radiation need to be developed and qualified.Proponents of the MSR design often talk of using U-233, bred from thorium, as fuel. Characteristics of the thorium fuel cycle include:1) U-233 breeding by Th-232 neutron capture. Fast or thermal neutron capture by Th-232 produces Th-233 (halflife 22min) beta decaying to Pa-233 (half-life 27days) and beta decaying again to U-233 (half-life 1.59 x 105 years) following the Neptunium decay series.2) U-233 can be chemically separated from Pa-233 and Th-232 in contrast to costly U-235/U 238 isotopic separation.3) From a nuclear non-proliferation stand point using thorium / U-233 is preferable. The breeding of U-233 contains trace amounts of a hard-gamma emitter: Tl-208. This makes U-233 difficult to handle and easier to detect.4) The hard-gamma emitting decay products U-233 means they are difficult to handle and fabricate into dioxide pellet fuel. The use of U-233 is more straight-forward in MSRs which only require their dissolution in the primary coolant.5) The thorium fuel cycle produces less long-life radioactive waste compared to the U-235/U238 fuel cycle.6) Thorium reserves are plentiful; its relative abundance is 4 times that of natural uranium and has the potential to supply earth’s energy demands for thousands of years.},

The proposed framework integrates topology optimization and generative models (e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs)) in an iterative manner to explore new design options, thus generating a large number of designs starting from limited previous design data. In addition, anomaly detection can evaluate the novelty of generated designs, thus helping designers choose among design options. The 2D wheel design problem is applied as a case study for validation of the proposed framework. The framework manifests better aesthetics, diversity, and robustness of generated designs than previous generative design methods.},

	abstract = {Generative design methods are capable of generating concepts and stimulating solutions based on robust and rigorous models of design conditions, design languages and design performance. The computer now becomes a design generator in addition to its more conventional role as draftsperson, visualizor, data checker and performance analyst. Motivated by the challenge to enable designers to easily develop meaningful input models of design intent to make best use of a structural generative method, this paper describes an initial combination of a generative design tool, eifForm, and an associative modeling system, Custom Objects, through the use of XML models. The current combined use is illustrated through an example involving generation of a set of 20 interrelated roof trusses with seven unique spans initiated by a parametric model of a saddle shaped stadium roof in Custom Objects. The paper concludes with a discussion of the synergies between associative modeling and generative systems and identifies future extensions aimed to exploit these synergies towards integrated performance-based generative design tools.},

	abstract = {A generative CAD based design exploration method is proposed. It is suitable for complex multicriteria design problems where important performance criteria are uncomputable. The method is based on building a genotype of the design within a history based parametric CAD system and then, varying its parameters randomly within pre-defined limits to generate a set of distinctive designs. The generated designs are then filtered through various constraint envelopes representing geometric viability, manufacturability, cost and other performance related constraints, thus reducing the vast design space into a smaller viable design space represented by a set of distinctive designs. These designs may then be further developed by the designer. The proposed generative design method makes minimal imposition on the designer’s work process and maintains both flexibility and fluidity that is required for creative design exploration. Its ability to work seamlessly with current CAD based design practices from early conceptual to detailed design is demonstrated. The design philosophy behind this generative method and the key steps involved in its implementation are presented with examples.},

Such systems make the computer a generative design tool and are already used extensively as a rapid prototyping technique in architecture and aeronautics. Combining a design generation tool with an analysis software and an evolutionary algorithm provides a methodology for optimising designs. This work combines NASA's parametric aircraft design tool (OpenVSP) with a ﬂuid dynamics solver (OpenFOAM) to create and analyse aircraft. An evolutionary algorithm is then used to generate a range of aircraft that maximise lift and reduce drag while remaining within the framework of the original design. Our approach allows the designer to automatically optimise their chosen design and to generate models with improved aerodynamic efﬁciency. Different components on three aircraft models are varied to highlight the ease and effectiveness of the parametric model optimisation.},

	abstract = {Soft robotics is a growing field of research and one of its challenges is how to efficiently design a controller for a soft morphology. This paper presents a marine soft robot inspired by the ghost knifefish that swims on the water surface by using an undulating fin underneath its body. We investigate how propagating wave functions can be evolved and how these affect the swimming performance of the robot. The fin and body of the robot are constructed from silicone and six wooden fin rays actuated by servo motors. In order to bypass the reality gap, which would necessitate a complex simulation of the fish, we implemented a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) directly on the physical robot to optimize its controller for travel speed. Our results show that evolving a simple sine wave or a Fourier series can generate controllers that outperform a hand programmed controller. The results additionally demonstrate that the best evolved controllers share similarities with the undulation patterns of actual knifefish. Based on these results we suggest that evolution on physical robots is promising for future application in optimizing behaviors of soft robots.},

The facility proposed in this paper would be a flexible platform for expanding the knowledge of fast spectrum neutron cross sections needed for next-generation fast reactor designs. The Fast Neutron Source (FNS) would be composed of both a fast and a thermal region to minimize the amount of uranium fuel and reduce overall material costs while maintaining flexibility for many potential fast neutron crosssection experiments. The FNS would be customizable and interchangeable down to 1 × 1 × 10-in.-volume sections. An optimal core design requires the adjustment of many factors to both reduce the cost and accurately reproduce the spectra of interest during an experiment. A genetic algorithm was developed to optimize this complex design problem while reducing design time and expert judgment. The genetic algorithm was able to vary multiple design factors in an unattended fashion from a random initial population of designs and arrived at a design comparable to an expertly designed assembly.},

	abstract = {Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are the creative design of nuclear reactors that have received considerable attention in recent years. Since there is insufficient operational experience in SMRs, extensive research on these types of reactors may be needed to improve the current level of these systems performance. Also, one of the approaches which can help the enhancement of a reactor power is changing its fuel geometry. For this purpose, as well as decreasing the maximum fuel temperature in the reactors, the technology of annular fuels with the ability of internal and external cooling shows its importance. The nuclear SMRs with annular fuel which is cooled internally and externally has the potential to increase high power density while maintaining a sufficient safety margin. The benefit of the dual cooled annular fuel design is that heat can be transferred to the coolant at both the outer and inner channels. Hence, in this study, for the first time, dual cooled annular fuel in the Small Modular Reactors is considered and studied thoroughly. In this paper, neutronics and natural circulation parameters are calculated for an SMR with Annular Fuel which is cooled internally and externally, with changes of the internal radius. By analyzing the fuel internal radius changes in a specific range via the neutronics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation codes, the effects of power peaking factor, effective multiplication coefficient and natural circulation parameters are investigated. For the purpose of data fitting, an artificial neural network is trained using the observed data. The input consists of different internal radiuses which yields to output consisting effective multiplication factor, power peaking factor and natural circulation parameters. The Optimal geometry of annular fuel is determined using the neural network by implementing the genetic algorithms based on these neutronics and natural circulation parameters. Finally, using a simulated optimal geometry in the hot channel by neutronics and CFD simulations, thermal–hydraulic and neutronics calculations are accomplished, and these parameters are compared with the conventional SMR which uses solid (conventional) fuel. One of the main results of the evaluation is that optimal internally and externally cooled fuel in the presented SMR has a satisfactory margin for the departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) and maximum fuel rod temperature relative to the solid fuel which is used in the conventional SMRs. Indeed, fuel center temperature of conventional SMR is much more than that of presented optimal SMR. Also, presented optimal geometry increases the core effective multiplication coefficient which leads to increase in the excess reactivity. Also, reduces total power peaking factor and improves natural circulation parameters compared to the conventional SMR.},

	abstract = {A module based optimization method using genetic algorithms (GA), and multivariate regression analysis has been developed to optimize a set of parameters in the design of a nuclear reactor. GA simulates natural evolution to perform optimization, and is widely used in recent times by the scientiﬁc community. The GA ﬁts a population of random solutions to the optimized solution of a speciﬁc problem. In this work, we have developed a genetic algorithm to determine the values for a set of nuclear reactor parameters to design a gas cooled fast breeder reactor core including a basis thermal–hydraulics analysis, and energy transfer. Multivariate regression is implemented using regression splines (RS). Reactor designs are usually complex and a simulation needs a signiﬁcantly large amount of time to execute, hence the implementation of GA or any other global optimization techniques is not feasible, therefore we present a new method of using RS in conjunction with GA. Due to using RS, we do not necessarily need to run the neutronics simulation for all the inputs generated from the GA module rather, run the simulations for a predeﬁned set of inputs, build a multivariate regression ﬁt to the input and the output parameters, and then use this ﬁt to predict the output parameters for the inputs generated by GA. The reactor parameters are given by the, radius of a fuel pin cell, isotopic enrichment of the ﬁssile material in the fuel, mass ﬂow rate of the coolant, and temperature of the coolant at the core inlet. And, the optimization objectives for the reactor core are, high breeding of U-233 and Pu-239 in desired power peaking limits, desired effective and inﬁnite neutron multiplication factors, high fast ﬁssion factor, high thermal efﬁciency in the conversion from thermal energy to electrical energy using the Brayton cycle, and high fuel burn-up. It is to be noted that we have kept the total mass of the fuel as constant. In this work, we present a module based (modular) approach to perform the optimization wherein, we have deﬁned the following modules: single fuel pin cell, whole core, thermal–hydraulics, and energy conversion. In each of the modules we have deﬁned a speciﬁc set of parameters and optimization objectives. The GA system (GAS), and RS together, play the role of optimizing each of the individual modules, and integrating the modules to determine the ﬁnal nuclear reactor core. However, implementation of GA could lead to a local minimum or a non-unique set of parameters, those meet the speciﬁc optimization objectives. The GA code is built using Java, neutronic analysis using MCNP6, thermal–hydraulics calculations using Java, and regression analysis using R.},

	abstract = {The Fluoride Salt Cooled High Temperature Reactor (FHR) is a liquid salt-cooled reactor utilizing TRISObased fuel. Its low operating pressure and large thermal margin offer attractive safety. However, its complex core design, in particular the double heterogeneity introduced by TRISO particles, as well as the presence of several moderating materials, require careful veriﬁcation and validation (V\&V) of the core physics modeling and simulation (M\&S) methods. Due to their ability to accurately simulate complex geometries and utilize continuous-energy nuclear data, Monte Carlo methods are used in this study to evaluate core physics phenomena and provide reference solutions for veriﬁcation of lower ﬁdelity methods. This work is focused on the FHR design with hexagonal fuel elements consisting of fuel plates (‘‘planks”), i.e., the Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) developed by ORNL. The pebble-bed FHR design, PB-FHR, is not directly considered in this work, although the results of this study are relevant for PB-FHR as well. The SERPENT Monte Carlo code is selected and utilized to perform core physics analyses of an FHR fuel assembly. The issues investigated include detailed ﬁssion distribution, quantiﬁcation of certain approximations, study of neutron spectra in different material regions, and impact of graphite density, temperature, and scattering matrix data. This study contributes to V\&V of modeling and simulation methods for FHR.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the continuous energy coarse mesh transport code COMET was used to provide the whole core transport solution to a set of stylized Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) benchmark problems. This set includes two full length single assembly and three full core conﬁgurations. Solving this type of reactor core is a signiﬁcant challenge to high and low order neutron transport methods because of its high heterogeneities due to TRISO fuel and burnable absorber particles imbedded in graphite plates with Y-shaped control blades and molten salt as coolant. The eigenvalue and ﬁssion density distributions calculated by COMET were compared with the direct Monte Carlo solutions. In the single assembly calculations, it was found that eight-bin expansion in energy and 2nd order expansion in the other phase space variables used by COMET are sufﬁcient for calculation of the eigenvalue and the assembly averaged ﬁssion density distribution, while 4th order expansion in space is necessary to obtain the stripe-wise ﬁssion density distribution with accuracy comparable to that of the continuous energy Monte Carlo method. It was also found that it is impractical to use Monte Carlo to generate the detailed solutions (stripe-wise ﬁssion density distribution) to the full core benchmark problems because of the prohibitive computation resource requirement (estimated to be about 2200 days on an 84-CPU cluster). It took only about 4.5 h on a single CPU for COMET to calculate the detailed solution including the stripe-wise ﬁssion density distribution in the entire core. Given that COMET agreed very well with Monte Carlo in terms of assembly averaged and stripe-wise ﬁssion density distributions in the single assembly problems as well as in terms of the assembly averaged ﬁssion density distribution in the full core problems, it was concluded that the continuous energy COMET can provide the reference solution to the stylized AHTR benchmark problems.
